<h6 id="introduction">Introduction</h6>

<p>Decision trees are a method used in machine learning to perform the <strong>classification</strong> and <strong>prediction</strong> of many phenomena such as weather events for example.</p>

<p>They are popular because the <strong>final model</strong> is easy to understand by practitioners and experts in the field of supervised learning. The final decision tree can explain exactly why a specific <strong>prediction</strong> has been made, which makes it very attractive for operational use.</p>

<p>Decision trees also provide the basis for more advanced ensemble methods such as <strong>random forests</strong> (Random Forest).</p>

<p>A script generating a data set has been put in place.</p>
