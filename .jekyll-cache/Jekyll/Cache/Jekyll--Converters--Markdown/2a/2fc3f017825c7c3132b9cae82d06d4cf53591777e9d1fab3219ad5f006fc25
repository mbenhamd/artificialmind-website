<p>His <a href="/ressources/memoir.pdf">intership memoir</a> was on interpretation related on neural network models and more specially <em>Biological interpretation of deep neural networks learned from transcriptomic data</em>.</p>

<p>He wrote a blog called <em>Artificial Mind</em>, in reference to Artificial Intelligence and accomplishment of an artificial mind on that subject.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I believe there is no deep difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer. It, therefore, follows that computers can, in theory, emulate human intelligence — and exceed it. <cite>Stephen Hawking</cite></p>
