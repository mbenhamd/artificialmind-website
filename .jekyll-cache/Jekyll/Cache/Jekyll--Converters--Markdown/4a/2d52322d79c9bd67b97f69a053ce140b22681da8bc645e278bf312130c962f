I"≥<p>The interpretation of neural networks and their predictions is a significant challenge. Neural networks are considered as ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù. Hence, there is a real need to make neural networks more interpretable, and this is particularly true in the medical field (Biological interpretation of deep neural networks learned from transcriptomic data).</p>

  <li>Development of a new model called Deep GONet.</li>
  <li>Ability to deep-dive into research papers, down to a technical depth required to translate them into code using both existing toolkits and self-developed code.</li>
