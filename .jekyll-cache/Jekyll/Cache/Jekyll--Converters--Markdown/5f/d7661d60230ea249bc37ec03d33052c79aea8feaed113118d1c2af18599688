<em>Presentation of the game available on my <a href="https://github.com/mbenhamd/Binero">Github repository</a></em>:</p>

<p><strong>Takuzu</strong> is a puzzle game from Japan. It is based on logic a bit like sudoku. It is usually a 10x10 or 8x8 grid, containing only 1s and 0s, which must be completed according to three rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>as many as 1 and 0 on each line and on each column.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>no more than 2 identical digits side by side.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 rows or 2 columns can not be identical.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Takuzu</strong> is also known as Binero or Bento.</p>

<p>After this quick presentation of the game, we agree that the game is a certain simplicity to implement in its basic version. For this we will describe later the structure of the game and the algorithms describing the rules of the game.</p>

<p>Throughout this documentation it should be noted that the language used is C.</p>

<p>The basic Binero object:</p>
<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">grille</span> <span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">taille</span> <span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>A binero is composed of a grid composed of 0 or 1 and a whole size.</p>
