I"Y<p>The interpretation of neural networks and their predictions is a major challenge. Neural networks
are considered as “black boxes” so there is a real need to make neural networks more interpretable
and this is particularly true in the medical field (Biological interpretation of deep neural networks learned from transcriptomic data).</p>
