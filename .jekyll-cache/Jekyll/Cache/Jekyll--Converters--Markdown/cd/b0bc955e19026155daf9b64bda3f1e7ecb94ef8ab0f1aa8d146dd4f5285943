I"…<p>Extreme learning machine (ELM), which can be viewed as a variant of Random Vector Functional Link (RVFL) network without the input-output direct connections, has been extensively used to create multi-layer (deep) neural networks. Such networks employ randomization based autoencoders (AE) for unsupervised feature extraction followed by an ELM classifier for final decision making.</p>
