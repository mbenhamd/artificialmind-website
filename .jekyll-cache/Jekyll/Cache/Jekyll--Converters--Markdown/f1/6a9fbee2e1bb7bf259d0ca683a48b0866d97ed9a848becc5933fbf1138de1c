<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>Interpretation and visual exploration of data from multidimensional data sets can be
a real headache for the human. While the 2D / 3D datasets are very easy to display: it is easy to represent the inherent structure of their data, it is not easy to
perform intuitive visualization for large data sets. In order to improve the visualization and interpretation capacity of these large multidimensional data sets, the
should be reduced while trying to keep as much information as possible. The purpose of the methods presented in this paper are twofold: to realize a reduction of the dimension by extraction of characteristics
but also allow the visual interpretation of the information kept

<p>We will study current visualization techniques as well as techniques for reducing
dimension to improve learning and its interpretation. It should be remembered that the family
methods of data analysis can be subdivided into two families of methods:</p>

  <li>Non-linear: Most of these methods are based on the notion of neighborhood, with graphs, or
simply linear combination of neighbors. These methods are more sensitive to the structures
non-linear data and tries to preserve the global / local properties of the data.
These two types of methods are based both on the idea that the size of many

At first we will present in a rather brief way each of the algorithms used, then we
will perform a comparative study of some linear and non-linear dimension reduction algorithms

The PCR used as initialization for ADL facilitates interpretation and improves results in

the ACP looks for relationships between variables while the MDS looks for similarities between observations

Finally, this project allowed us to realize several techniques seen in progress on two datasets
