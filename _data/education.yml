    We are specialized in Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning for Data Scientist). We study unsupervised, semi-supervised and supervised learning methods and visualization methods. We also research reinforcement learning. These methods are commonly used in the context of data mining which is the art of extracting information or even knowledge from increasingly large data. These can come from various fields such as genomics, textual analysis, images, networks and speeches.
