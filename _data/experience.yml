    The interpretation of neural networks and their predictions is a major challenge. Neural networks
    are considered as "black boxes" so there is a real need to make neural networks more interpretable
    and this is particularly true in the medical field (Biological interpretation of deep neural networks learned from transcriptomic data).
    * Biological interpretation of deep neural networks learned from transcriptomic data.
    * Development of a new model called Deep GONet.
    * Ability to deep-dive into research papers, down to a technical depth required to translate them into code using both existing toolkits and self-developed code.

    and Youtube that must be linked with data provided by companies and the statistics department
    of a ministry.
    * Development of a database needed for these processes (MySQL, Python, etc.) and capture (API
    RESTful).
    * RELOC project with ULULE and KKBB databases.
