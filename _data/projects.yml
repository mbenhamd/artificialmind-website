    Our primary purpose is to build a robust platform system for real-time data analysis of tweets on twitter trends. We also want to analyse all the tweets of 2017 based on a downloaded sample of data (average of 6 To). All this data analysis will be accessible via a [web interface](https://twitter.yannistannier.io/) that will be developed.
