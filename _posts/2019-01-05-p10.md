*Presentation of the game available on my [Github repository](https://github.com/mbenhamd/Binero)*:

**Takuzu** is a puzzle game from Japan. It is based on logic a bit like sudoku. It is usually a 10x10 or 8x8 grid, containing only 1s and 0s, which must be completed according to three rules:

-   as many as 1 and 0 on each line and on each column.
    
-   no more than 2 identical digits side by side.
    
-   2 rows or 2 columns can not be identical.
    
**Takuzu** is also known as Binero or Bento.

After this quick presentation of the game, we agree that the game is a certain simplicity to implement in its basic version. For this we will describe later the structure of the game and the algorithms describing the rules of the game.

Throughout this documentation it should be noted that the language used is C.

The basic Binero object:
```c
int **grille ;
int taille ;
```
A binero is composed of a grid composed of 0 or 1 and a whole size.
