*Presentation of a R project to introduce data science available on my [Github repository](https://github.com/mbenhamd/cereals-data-project)*:

The file provided is a summary of the nutritional characteristics of 77 cereals present in the majority of American businesses.

The dataset processed in this project focuses on the main industrially produced grain products that have been on sale in US stores in recent years. Food and especially the "Healthy Food" remain a major concern for many people nowadays, some states even encourage their people to consume better but also more reasonably to reduce the health risks associated with a consumption greater than the daily needs means recommended by WHO. Current research indicates that adults should not consume more than 30% of their calories as fat, they would also need about 50 to 65 grams of protein per day and should provide the rest of their calorie intake by consuming carbohydrates. These figures given by way of example are to be modulated according to the sex, the age but also the physical activity of the targeted person. A recommended diet should also contain 20 to 35 grams of dietary fiber.
