###### Introduction

Decision trees are a method used in machine learning to perform the **classification** and **prediction** of many phenomena such as weather events for example.

They are popular because the **final model** is easy to understand by practitioners and experts in the field of supervised learning. The final decision tree can explain exactly why a specific **prediction** has been made, which makes it very attractive for operational use.

Decision trees also provide the basis for more advanced ensemble methods such as **random forests** (Random Forest).

A script generating a data set has been put in place.
