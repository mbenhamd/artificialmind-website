*Presentation of a Multi Agent System Project available on my [Github repository](https://github.com/mbenhamd/twitter-analysis-mas)*:

It's an application using JADE Framework with Swing for the graphical interface.
The aim is to analyse sentiment between a conversation between two agents.

At the end of the conversation, we do the confusion matrix after the sentiment analysis using Indico API [Website here](https://indico.io/).
