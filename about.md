**Mohamed BEN HAMDOUNE** is a Data Scientist from Paris, France. After graduating from [University Paris Descartes](https://www.parisdescartes.fr/en/homepage/) with a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, he is currently searching for work.

His [intership memoir](/ressources/memoir.pdf) was on interpretation related on neural network models and more specially *Biological interpretation of deep neural networks learned from transcriptomic data*.

He wrote a blog called *Artificial Mind*, in reference to Artificial Intelligence and accomplishment of an artificial mind on that subject.
>I believe there is no deep difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer. It, therefore, follows that computers can, in theory, emulate human intelligence â€” and exceed it. <cite>Stephen Hawking</cite>
